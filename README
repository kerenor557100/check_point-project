1. please compile the phonebook program using the below command : 
   gcc -g phonebook.c -o phonebook
   it will generate a phonebook binary that contains several bugs .
2. The program manages contacts 
3. go over the program code and explore i - note that the program contains several bugs that prevent it from running correctly.
   the main idea is to fix it .
 
some bugs can be found using various tools : valgrind , gdb or regular code flow debug .
the below steps 4,5 will help you detect the bugs .
   
4. run the program under valgrind : 
	valgrind --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all  --leak-resolution=high --trace-children=no --show-below-main=yes --num-callers=50 --log-file=phonebook.log ./phonebook
5. enter at least 10 new contacts and try all the options below :
        [1] |--> Insert
        [2] |--> Delete
        [3] |--> Edit
        [4] |--> Search
        [5] |--> Show All
        [6] |--> Sort
        [7] |--> Help
        [8] |--> Exit

6. what are the bugs hidden  in each of the options if any ? please use valgrind/gdb in order to fix the program and make it fully work.
7. how would you extend the program ?
